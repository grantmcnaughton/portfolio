### ElGamal Methods in Elliptic Curve Cryptography

This brief explores the mathematical foundations of ElGamal cryptography as implemented on elliptic curves. It outlines how the ElGamal cryptosystem works on a general group structure, introduces finite prime fields as the underlying mathematical foundation, and then builds up to elliptic curve groups. The brief includes detailed mathematical definitions, theorems with proofs, and practical examples using small prime fields to demonstrate the concepts. The Jupyter Notebook shows how ECC can be implemented practically, with a working example of the cryptosystem built from scratch.
