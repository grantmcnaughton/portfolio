### Solving Polynomial Systems Using Subresultants

The paper describes a method for solving systems of polynomial equations using subresultants. It introduces a mathematical technique to transform a system of polynomial equations into a triangular form that's easier to solve. The method works in three main steps: first using subresultants to convert the system into triangular form (where each equation involves one fewer variable than the previous), then using back-substitution to find potential solutions, and finally checking which of these solutions actually solve the original system. The paper provides detailed mathematical proofs showing that this transformation preserves all solutions of the original system, and includes concrete algorithms for implementing each step of the process.
