### Solving Polynomial Systems Using Subresultants

This brief describes a method for solving systems of polynomial equations using subresultants. It introduces a mathematical technique to transform a system of polynomial equations into a triangular form that's easier to solve. The method works in three main steps: first, use matrix subresultants to convert the system into triangular form, then use back-substitution to find potential solutions, and finally check the potential solutions to find a valid system solution. The brief provides detailed mathematical proofs showing that this transformation preserves all solutions of the original system, and includes concrete algorithms for implementing each step of the process. The Jupyter Notebook shows how this method can be implemented using a system of equations with three unknowns.
