### Classification and Regression Trees Research

Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is a machine learning technique I've analyzed that builds decision trees for both categorical and continuous predictions. I trace its development from 12th century medical diagrams to Breiman's foundational 1984 work, exploring how trees are constructed using various impurity metrics (misclassification, Gini, entropy). To demonstrate the method's practical application, I implemented CART in MATLAB using a cereal dataset, studying how pruning affects model accuracy and complexity. The paper concludes with an analysis of CART's strengths in interpretability and weaknesses in overfitting.
