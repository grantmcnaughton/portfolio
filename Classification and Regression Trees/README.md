### Classification and Regression Trees Research

CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is a machine learning method that uses decision trees to analyze data by repeatedly splitting it into subgroups. Developed by Breiman et al. in 1984, CART has evolved from early medical decision trees into a sophisticated statistical tool. The method excels at data visualization and handling mixed data types but can be prone to overfitting, which is managed through pruning techniques. Its practical applications range from medical diagnostics to general statistical analysis, though it's often most effective when combined with other methods.
