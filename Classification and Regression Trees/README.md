### Classification and Regression Trees Research

CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is a machine learning method that uses decision trees to analyze data by repeatedly splitting it into subgroups. This paper provides a brief overview of the history of CART and an explanation of the statistical concepts behind it. The paper explains the metrics used in CART, best practices for growing and pruning decision trees, an exploration of MATLAB's implementation of CART algorithms, and important strengths and weaknesses to keep in mind when using it. Developed by Leo Breiman et al. in 1984, CART has evolved from early medical decision trees into a sophisticated statistical tool. The method excels at data visualization and handling mixed data types but can be prone to overfitting, which is managed through pruning techniques. Its practical applications are highly varied with especially high utilization in medical research, though it's often most effective when combined with other methods.
