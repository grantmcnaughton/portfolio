### Error Correcting Codes

This brief explores error-correcting codes, specifically the Reed-Solomon and Berlekamp-Welch algorithms. Reed-Solomon encoding, introduced in 1960, works by converting a message into a polynomial function and evaluating it at different points to create redundancy. The Berlekamp-Welch decoding algorithm, developed in 1986, efficiently recovers the original message from a corrupted version. The brief includes mathematical proofs showing the reliability of these methods while the Jupyter Notebook shows how the algorithms can be implemented with a working example.
